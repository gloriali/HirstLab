REMC Fetal Brain Project
=====================
* [FetalBrainLibraries.tsv](./FetalBrainLibraries.tsv): Fetal Brain samples metadata.   
* [Summary](./Summary/Summary.md): Results summary and integrated analysis, including [Figures](./Summary/Figures.md), and [hydroxymethylation](./Summary/hydroxy.md).   
* [RNAseq](./RNAseq/RNAseq.md): Transcriptome analysis, including [DE genes](./RNAseq/gene/DEgene.md), [isoforms](./RNAseq/isoform/fetalBrain_isoform.md), [junction validation](./RNAseq/junction/junction_valid.md), and [epigenetic profiles](./RNAseq/epiProfile/epiProfile.md).   
* [WGBS](./WGBS/WGBS.md): DMR analysis between Cortex and GE with WGBS libraries.
* [MeDIP](./MeDIP/MeDIP.md): DMR analysis with MeDIP fractional methylation calls.  
* [MethylCRF](./MethylCRF): DMR analysis with MethylCRF methylation calls, _discontinued_.
* [HisMod](./HisMod/HisMod.md): Histone modifications analysis, _will add ChromHMM_.
* [SNP](./SNP): Validate monozygotic twins with SNPs.
