Fetal Brain - DNA methylation analysis with WGBS
=================================================
* [WGBS.Rmd](./WGBS.md): summary results for DMR analysis in WGBS - cortex vs GE
* [WGBS.DM.sh](./WGBS.DM.sh): DM CpGs in WGBS between Cortex and GE with methyl_diff
* [WGBS.DMR.R](./WGBS.DMR.R): DMR analysis in WGBS between Cortex and GE with methyl_diff
* [nonCpG.sh](./nonCpG.sh): CHH and CHG methylation analysis    
* [WGBS.R](./WGBS.R): analysis on WGBS fractional methylation calls
* [WGBS_bin200.R](./WGBS_bin200.R): calculate DNA mehtylation levels for 200bp bins with WGBS calls
* [WGBS_t.R](./WGBS_t.R): DMR analysis with t-test on WGBS fractional calls
