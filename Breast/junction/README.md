=====================================
* [REMC_junction_validate.Rmd (.md, .html)](./REMC_junction_validate.md): Summary results for isoform validation with junction reads (results from junction_valid_new.R)
* [REMC_junction_summary.Rmd (.md, .html)](./REMC_junction_summary.md): Summary results for isoform identification with junction reads (results from junction.R)         
* all: isoform-junction analysis with RM035, RM080, and RM084         
* [junction.R](./junction.R): isoform identification and validation with junction reads for RM084
* [junction_valid.R](./junction_valid.R): isoform validation with junction files generated from GSC pipeline for RM084
* [junction_valid_new.R](./junction_valid_new.R): isoform validation with junction files generated from Misha's script for RM084
