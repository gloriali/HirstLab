Pipeline shell scripts
=======================
* [WGBS.combine.sh](./WGBS.combine.sh): shell script to combine coverage from both strand for CpGs.
* [methyl_diff.sh](./methyl_diff.sh): shell script to identify DM CpGs for WGBS using methyl_diff.  
* [DMR.dynamic.sh](./DMR.dynamic.sh): shell script to collapse DM CpGs into DMRs.
* [DMR.intersect.sh](./DMR.intersect.sh): intersecting DMRs with genomic regions and report CpG% breakdown in intergenic, intron, exon, gene, promoter regions.
