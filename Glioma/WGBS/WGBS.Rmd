## RPKM of DNA methylation regulators

```{r modifier_RPKM}
(DNAme_regulators_RPKM_figure)
```

## CpG coverage profile
* TCGA data have particularly lower coverage.       

```{r coverage}
(qc_5mC_coverage_figure)
```

## Global hypermethylation in IDH mut glioma
* Genome-wide and CGI hypermethylation in IDH mutant glioma samples: CEMT19, CEMT22, and CEMT_47.      
* CEMT_21 (10% IDH mutation frequency) showed methylation levels closer to IDH wildtype samples.    
* TCGA data seem to have lower fractional methylation geonme-wide, possibly due to different processing pipeline.         
* Whiskers of the box plot represent 10% and 90% quantile.     

```{r global_5mC}
(qc_5mC_profile_figure)
```

## Clustering
* CGI clustering showed clusters based on IDH mut and wt.      

```{r cluster}
op <- par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 8))
plot(pearson_genome_5mC_dend, main = "genome-wide pearson", horiz = TRUE)
plot(pearson_CGI_5mC_dend, main = "CGI pearson", horiz = TRUE)
par(op)
```

## Enhancer and 5mC
* Hypermethylated enhancers also present at promoters - more so in IDH mutant glioma    
* Expression levels of the closest genes are not significantly affected by 5mC at these bivalent enhancers     
* Genes associated with each profile group are significantly overlapped across the three IDH mutant gliomas

```

## DNA methylation changes around CGI edges
* CGIs are hypermethylated in IDH mutant gliomas.     
* DNA methylation changes around CGI occur at the edge of CGIs.     

```{r 5mC_CGI, fig.height = 6}
(CGI_edge_delta_figure)
```

## DMRs between gliomas and NPCs  
### DMR identification 
  * Identify DM CpGs     
  	+ CpG coverage in both samples $\ge$ 3;        
    + methyl_diff one-sided p-value $\le$ 0.0005;  
    + delta fractional methylation $\ge$ 0.6;  
    + fractional methylation of one sample $\ge$ 0.75.   
  * Collapse DM CpGs into DMRs     
    + adjacent DM CpGs have the same DM status;    
    + distance between adjacent CpGs (size) $\le$ 500bp;   
    + No. of CpGs within each DMR $\ge$ 3.   
    
### Total DMR length
* Hypermethylation in IDH mut samples.    
* Hypomethylation in IDH wt glioma: CEMT_23 (GBM).     
* CEMT_21 had the least amount of DMRs and no bias towards hyper or hypo.      
* Results against different NPCs were reasonably similar (intersect statistically significant).      

```{r DMR_summary}
(DMR_summary_figure)
```

### DMR GREAT analysis
* DMR - gene association
	+ Proximal: 5kb upstream, 1kb downstream.     
	+ Distal: up to 20kb.         

#### Hypermethylated DMRs
* IDH mut and wt samples showed different terms, and CEMT_21 showed similar terms as wt.      
	+ Disease Ontology: mut showed CNS/brain disease.     
	+ GOBP: mut showed neurogenesis/brain development, wt showed regulation of biosynthetic process.   
	+ GOCC: wt showed transcription factor complex, mut also showed membranes and neurons.

(GREAT_DMR_CEMT_23_hyper_figure)
```

#### Hypomethylated DMRs
* IDH mut had few significant term (CEMT22 had none), wt had cancer related terms, and CEMT21 showed similar terms to mut.

### Percentage of hyper CpGs in hyper CGIs

```{r hyperCG_hyperDMR}
(CGI_DMR_hyper_DM_figure)
```

### Methylated CGIs associated with transcription   

```{r CGI_K36}
kable(CGI_hyper_summary, format = "html", align = "c", row.names = F)
```

### Hypermethylated CGIs associated with transcription   
* There are on average 15% of hypermethylated CGIs overlapping with H3K36me3 enriched regions, 8% of them are not in genebody in IDH mut gliomas, suggesting possible enhancer RNA expression.    

```{r DMR_CGI_K36}
kable(CGI_DMR_hyper_summary, format = "html", align = "c", row.names = F)
```

![DMR_CGI_K36](WGBS_files/figure-html/hyperCGI_K36.1.png)        

### DMR enrichment in genomic regions 
* Enriched in CGIs and CGI shores, esp. hypermethylation in CGIs.    
* Promoter: TSS +/- 2kb; CGI_shore: CGI +/- 2kb.      

```{r DMR_genomicBreak}
(genomic_breakdown_figure)
```

### DMR enrichment in chromatin states
* Hypermethylated regions were enriched in H3K27me3 marked chromatin states.       
* Hypomethylated regions were enriched in enhancer regions.    

```{r DMR_ChromHMM}
(DMR_ChromHMM_summary_figure)
```

### DMR intersect with differentially marked histone modifications  

```{r DMR_DHM}
(DMR_DHM_enrich_figure)
```

### DMR associated with DE genes
* Hypermethylated DMRs in the promoter regions are significantly associated with both UP and DN regulated genes.         

```{r DMR_DE}
(DMR_DE_figure)
kable(hyper_UP_K27ac_summary, format = "html", align = "c", row.names = F)
```
